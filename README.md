## General Information
The purpose of this project is to have a better understanding of basic usage of multi threading programming. Furtheremore, deadlock is commonly a big issue in Software Development. This program deals with the usage of shared variables and a deadlock avoidance. 

## Technologies Used
This program is written in C on Linux environment. A vim editor was used.  

## Strength 
Since this program was written in C, the game can be simulated pretty quickly. Even when the game was simulated with one million rounds to play, there were no issues. 

## Setup
There is only one program, baccharact.c. Thus, make an exectuable file and run the executable file with a number of rounds specified.
